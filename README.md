# LHC Commissioning 2022

## Introduction

This repository collects supporting material for my presentation about the 2022 commissionning in the ABP group information meeting on June 9th, 2022.

The Beamer presentation can best be viewed on the corresponding [overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/9476788113pvcnhqchxjdx).

## Supporting Materials

A [Commissioning Overview](./overview.md) collects the logbook summaries for quick lookup of
what happened on which day.

## Presentation

`presentation.tex` contains the LaTeX source code for the presentation pdf (with "animations").

A more user-friendly and readable version of the talk will be in `handout.tex`, with all the animations
and redundant sub-slides removed.
